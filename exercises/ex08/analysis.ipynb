    "I wanted to make lectures 100% synchronous but according to the mode and mean of the survey data, most students prefer asynchronous lectures. The data from this survey refutes my idea that synchronous lectures would be the best option because most students do not believe there is a need to move from asynchronous lectures. I believe students with no experience with programming will be most negatively affected if class remains both synchronous and asynchronous. However, I do not think any stakeholder will be negatively affected with lectures being entirely synchronous. I believe my idea makes sense because most people taking this class have little to no experience with programming and that makes it extremely difficult to learn by primarily watcing lecture videos. The survey question asking about years of programming experience supports my argument by indicating how many of the students taking this class have little programming experience. Even though according to the survey data most people do not agree with me, I still making class entirely synchrously is the best way to learn in comp 110."
